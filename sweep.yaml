description: "This project aims to recreate Disney's Enchanted Tiki Room using Squawkers McCaw birds, a Raspberry Pi, and additional hardware. Create your own automated bird orchestra and bring the magic into your living room!"
rules:
  - "There should be no debug log or print statements in production code."
  - "All functions should have parameters and output annotated with type hints. Use list, tuple and dict instead of typing.List, typing.Tuple and typing.dict."
  - "Leftover TODOs in the code should be handled."
  - "All new business logic should have corresponding unit tests in the same directory. For example, sweepai/api_test.py tests sweepai/api.py. Use unittest and unittest.mock as required."
  - "Any clearly inefficient or repeated code should be optimized or refactored."
  - "Remove any comments before code that are obvious. For example `# this prints hello world; print('hello world')`."


#  - "We use unit tests for our code. If we have "class.py", we should have "class_test.py" in the same directory."
